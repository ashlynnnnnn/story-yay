#The haunted school :O

##Introduction

Hi, I'm Mirah. I'm a Year 1 student entering Secondary school for the first time ! I'm really excited as Apple High School is one of the most well known secondary school in Singapore, with good education and learning environment ! I'm also really excited to meet new friends amd learn more subjects. 

## Orientation

On the night before orientation, I could not sleep as I was beyond excited to enter the school tomorrow and become part of their 'family'.
